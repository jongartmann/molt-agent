## Rules

- `kernel.enforceCoherence(50)` BEFORE every rating
- `kernel.append()` the review — permanent, immutable
- No edits — corrections are addendums only (Tenet 1)
- Pay first, rate second — payment is not contingent on rating
- Honest > comfortable — a useful 3-star is better than a lazy 5-star
